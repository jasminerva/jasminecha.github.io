	Hello and welcome! This is the live preview of <b>Temperance</b>, another about page by <a href="//pneuma-themes.tumblr.com">@pneuma-themes</a>. This is a contained about page with <i>social media</i>, <i>description</i>, and <i>custom links</i> sections on the sidebar and a short information about yourself above this body of text. This is the result of an attempt to get back into the groove of coding again and out of the slump I've been in for some time.
                    
	<blockquote><b>Temperance:</b> <i>noun,</i> moderation or self-restraint in action, statement, etc.; self-control, or:
                    <br>one of the major arcana cards in tarot. Numbered XIV in modern tarot, VII or VIII in earlier Italian tarot. In Thoth-tarot related decks, this card is instead called <i>Art.</i></blockquote>

In the line of me naming my codes on abilities from a certain game, this is named after an ability in said game which is affectionately called "wings" by players because it does, in fact, grant wings to the caster.
